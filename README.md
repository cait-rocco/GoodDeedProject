# Good Deed

## Functionality Summary

Good Deed is a personal web application project which allows charities and volunteers to connect and fill man-power needs for those charities. Charities can create an account where they can post details about events in which they need volunteers and allows volunteers to easily commit to filling those slots. Volunteers will be able to search for, view details, and follow charities. Followed charities will appear on their home screen where they can easily navigate to see upcoming events and volunteer opportunities. They will also be able to quickly see and manage their committed times.
